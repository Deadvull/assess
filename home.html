  <h2>What chess is</h1>
  <p>Chess is a two-player strategy board game that has been played for centuries. It is believed to have originated in northern India in the 6th century and later spread to Persia, and then to the Arab world, and eventually to Europe. The game is played on a square board divided into 64 squares of alternating colors, typically black and white. Each player starts with 16 pieces, including one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means putting it under attack in such a way that it cannot escape capture on the next move. Chess is known for its complexity and the depth of its strategic possibilities, which has made it a popular game among enthusiasts and a subject of study for mathematicians and computer scientists.</p>
